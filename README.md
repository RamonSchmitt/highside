# Highside Test

A simple blog app for the highside test

I had some troubles with the authentication of the api i didn't have much experience with
authentication on apis.
I did manage to get the requests working in postman but i didn't find any blogs there.

Instead i've placed some dummy blogs in componentdidmount to show what my skills in react are so far.

First i drew a simple mockup to determine which components i should make. Then i made the "dumb components".

After that i created an empty post object in the state in which the values given by the user could be placed.

Once the form is submitted i concatenated the post object with the data object to form the new state.

I've used a boilerplate from stephen grider, I do know how to create one myself but for a quick start on this project i taught this will do.
